# Sorting algorithms

Here the most common sorting algorithms for different data structures are implemented.

## Algorithms 

- Insertion Sort sorts a given sequence of comparable elements in O(n2).
- Merge Sort sorts a given sequence of comparable elements in O(nlog n), with a constant factor C1.
- Quick Sort sorts a given sequence of comparable elements on the average in O(nlog n), with a constant factor C2.
- Counting Sort, Bucket Sort, Radix Sort sort a given sequence of non-negative integers in O(n).

## Data structures

- a dynamic array implemented as ```std::vector<T>```
- a doubly linked list implemented as a template class ```LinkedList<T>```

## Testing
The complexity of the algorithms is estimated in a series of experiments on some randomly created data (sequences of numbers/strings to be sorted).
